# Tutorial Assigment - Describing communities in R

The tutorial can be accessed as a webpage [here](https://kingakaszap.github.io/describing_communities/). Alternatively, it is contained within this repo as a Markdown file: [Click here to see it!](tutorial/tutorial.md)

All material needed to complete this tutorial can be found in this repository. This repo also includes my workflow and the background of the assignment. If you are only interested in completing the tutorial, I suggest you do it in [this public repository](https://github.com/kingakaszap/describing_communities) instead.

## Tutorial Aims:
1. Learn how ecological communities can be described in R
2. Undestand basic indices such as richness and diversity, and learn how to calculate them in R
3. Learn the basics of visualising community composition
