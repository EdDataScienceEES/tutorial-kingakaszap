## Diversity analysis
[from here](https://www.davidzeleny.net/anadat-r/doku.php/en:diversity_analysis)

- Diversity is a measure of quantifying different states in a system. In ecological communities, these states are usually species
- Diversity is considered an emergent property of a community, acting at the community level, but not at the level of teh individual species
- Important measure in conservation: indicator of wellbeing of ecological systems, communities
- two components: *species richness* - no of species in a community and *evenness* (=shape of species abundance distribution; fact that some species are common and others rare.
- Different evennes causes functional differences between communities: if evenness is high, interspecific competition is dominant, while is evenness is low, interspecific competititon prevails.
- SAD curve: species abundance distribution, would be funny to include because of the name. An important indicator of underlying community assembly processes.
- We estimate diversity of a community by sampling it -> sampling is always incomplete (not all species present are detected). - no of species detected with the same sampling effort depends on evenness, as detailed in the forest example.

- diversity estimated from sampled data is dependent on sampling effort, and if we want to compare diversity among different communities, sampling effort should be standardized.
which can be done with rarefaction (species accumulation) curves.
- Whittaker's concept of alpha, beta and gamma diversity: building on fisher's alpha,
- alpha = local species richness
- gamma = regional species richness
- beta = change in species composition among samples
- beta diversity: a fundamentally different concept from alpha and gamma. Complex topic and many ways of seeing it. beta(d) - differentiation diversity: similarity between pairs of samples, beta(p): proportional diversity - relatiomship between scales, gamma/alpha.(?)
