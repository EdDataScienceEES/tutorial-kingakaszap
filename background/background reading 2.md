## grunwald lab on diversity statistics

- diversity in the ecological sense is intuitively understood as the complexity of a community of organisms

- two main categories:alpha and beta div (whittaker 1960)

- alpha: div within a simple sample, generally based on the number and relative abundance of taxa 

-beta: also uses number and rel. abundance but measures variation between samples

- basically alpha div describes a single sample, and beta describes how two samples compare.

-common alpha diversity statistics:
1. shannon: how difficult it is to predict the identity of a randomly chosen individual
2. simpson: probability that two randomly chosen individuals are from the same species
