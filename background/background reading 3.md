-   "Measures to estimate biodiversity from field observations"

-   diversity indexes: a quantitative estimate of biological variability in space or time that *can be used to compare communities (biological entities)*

- Richness: A measure of species present at a certain location.
Species richness is the simplest measure of biodiversity, just a count of different species in an area. Strongly dependent on sampling size and effort.So this measure is always strongly influenced by sampling effort. (Measures trying to account for this: Margalef's diversity index and Menhinick's diversity index - for further reading)

- Evennes indices: expresses how evenly individuals in a community are distributed among different species.
Shannon-Wiener: most widely used index in ecological literature. 
Simpsons index

-Species - abundance representations: Most diversity and evenness indices are based on the relative abundance of species: estimates of p(i) where p(i)= n(i)/N
Species abundance relation: some species are rare, whereas others are more abundant.
-> RANK ABUNDANCE PLOT:  species are ranked in sequence from most to least abundant along the horizontal (or x) axis. Their abundances are typically displayed in a log10 format on the y axis, so that species whose abundances span several orders of magnitude can be easily accommodated on the same graph. In addition, proportional and or percentage abundances are often used.
->The collector’s curve addresses a different problem. When the sampling effort is increased, and thus the number of individuals N caught, new species will appear in the collection. A collector’s curve expresses the number of species as a function of the number of specimens caught. As more specimens are caught, a collector’s curve can reach an asymptotic value. However, this hardly does occur in practice due to the vague boundaries of ecological communities: as the sampling effort increases, the number of different patches increases as well.
-> The species-abundance plot displays the number of species that are represented by 1,2,…,n individuals against the corresponding abundance. This plot can only be drawn if the collection is large and contains many species. The species are generally grouped in logarithmic density classes.

->Species-abundance distributions (SADs) describe the distribution of population densities of all the species in a community. They are intermediate-complexity descriptors of a community's diversity: more informative than species richness but less detailed than a list of species and their abundances. The universally observed pattern is that most species in a community are rare, while a few are common, with abundances spanning orders of magnitude. The most abundant species are generally considered core species, while rare species are occasional visitors from different adjacent habitats. 

- More reading on different SAD forms (log normal etc) and what they mean. Mention that axes are usually log transformed, but we won't do that as it is a small sample here and we are not interested in the bigger picture for the purpose of this tutorial. We are just drawing conclusions based on the visual representation.
