### Diversity measures?? Vegan package? Just species accumulation curves?

[vegan tutorial](https://peat-clark.github.io/BIO381/veganTutorial.html) - not a lot of comments, includes rarefaction curves, only works with vegan, not too much code, uses dune

[vegan cheatsheet](https://rpubs.com/an-bui/vegan-cheat-sheet) - includes some stuff on diversity, and other stuff which is too complicated for my brain

[background theory](https://www.davidzeleny.net/anadat-r/doku.php/en:diversity_analysis) - background theory on diversity

[biodiversity workshop](https://kembellab.ca/r-workshop/biodivR/SK_Biodiversity_R.html) - a bit too complicated and too many things. But includes a section where richness/div is compared with boxplots, plus a t-test is ran to see if diff was significant.

[grunwald lab analysis of microbiome data](https://grunwaldlab.github.io/analysis_of_microbiome_community_data_in_r/07--diversity_stats.html) - the first bit is useful, although the code doesnt run. Uses vegan all the way.

[rarefaction examples](https://www.davidzeleny.net/anadat-r/doku.php/en:rarefaction_examples) - also looks complicated, but specifically about SA curves.

[diversity indeces](https://www.davidzeleny.net/anadat-r/doku.php/en:div-ind_r) - description of indeces and functions with vegan, but no examples

[vegan-ecological diversity](http://www2.uaem.mx/r-mirror/web/packages/vegan/vignettes/diversity-vegan.pdf) - by this Jari guy. includes all functions for div, rarefaction, rank abundance in vegan, but looks complicated.

[ecological diversity analysis using vegan wiki page](https://wiki.bits.vib.be/index.php/Ecology_analysis_using_vegan) - not sure i can use this as it loads the data as a matrix, and i dont rly understand how to work with that

[background theory](https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/characterizing-communities-13241173/#:~:text=Species%20richness%20is%20simply%20the,such%20as%20Shannon's%20Index%20H') - species richness, diversity and frequency distribution curves.

[species richness flutterby tutorial](https://www.flutterbys.com.au/stats/tut/tut13.2.html) - code does not run but may help with richness struggles

[community ecology with vegan rpubs](https://rpubs.com/mbh038/719881) - uses dune

[cran package vegan](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan/vegan.pdf)

[primer of ecology diversity with r](https://hankstevens.github.io/Primer-of-Ecology/diversity.html#species-composition) - finally something thats not vegan (me every day lol)!! - this might actually be useful
