### **Title Ideas:**

-   *Basic community ecology in R*

-   *Describing communities in R*

-   *Assessing biological diversity in R*

### **Outline:**

-   Introduction: What is community ecology? Why is it important? How do we characterize communities?

-   Part 1 - tidying data

-   Part 2 - species richness

-   Part 3 - Rarefaction curves

-   Part 4 - Rank abundance curves

-   Part 5 - Diversity indeces

### Intro

-   community: a group of species that occur together in space and time

-   In this tutorial, you will learn the basics of 4 methods to assess community composition /species diversity:

    1.  Species richness
    2.  Graphical measures (Rank abundance/ also rarefaction??)
    3.  Species abundance models
    4.  General indices of species diversity and evenness

### Species richness

-   Number of species in an area - numerical characteristic in a community.

### Rank abundance curves

-   Conservation biology focuses on rare species; can be used to compare two communities - determine evenness

### Species diversity

-   Accounts for variation in both number of species, AND the way individuals within a community are distributed among species. Incorporates richness AND evenness (comonness vs rarity)

-   Indeces: Simpson's index of dominance (probability that two individuals drawn randomly from a sample will belong to the same species. 0-1. Is the community relatively even, or is one or a few species very dominant?

-   Indeces: simpsons index of diversity 1-D, ranges from 0 to 1, 0: low diversity, 1 = high diversity

-   Simpsons reciprocal index: similar to simpsons diversity, but ranges from 1 to S (total number of species present in communities measured. 1/Dom.
