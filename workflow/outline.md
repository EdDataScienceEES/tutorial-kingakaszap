**What is my tutorial about?**

Analyzing diversity in R/Characterizing communities (So that I can include species richness measure as well as diversity indeces).

**What am I including in the tutorial?**

- Why is this important
- Different types of measures (alpha, beta, gamma, shannon, simpson)
- rarefaction curves
- visualising differences in diversity (mainly boxplot I think)
- using vegan (initially maybe start by how to do things in base r so that its understandable what we do, and then introuce functions of vegan -not sure)

**what steps do I need to do?**

- background reading on characterizing& comparing communities and measures of doing so
- background reading& completion of doing these in R& completing tutorials?
- coding club tutorial on how to make a coding club tutorial
- finding a good dataset
